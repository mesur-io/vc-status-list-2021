## Introduction

This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials.

## Goals

Provide a location for an issuer of a Verifiable Credential [VC-Data-Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) to link to a location where a verifier can check to see if a credential has been suspended or revoked.

## How does it work?

At the most basic level, status information for all verifiable credentials issued by an issuer are expressed as simple binary values. The issuer keeps a bitstring list of all verifiable credentials it has issued. Each verifiable credential is associated with a position in the list. If the binary value of the position in the list is 1 (one), the verifiable credential is revoked; if it is 0 (zero), it is not revoked. The verifier can then check the status of a verifiable credential by looking up the position of the verifiable credential in the bitstring list. This is the basic model used for Revocation and Suspension.

A status list may have multiple states, exposed via a series of status messages. These status messages are intended to be extensible and interoperable with existing status message vocabularies. The status messages are intended to be both human-readable and machine-readable. The status messages are intended to be used by verifiers to determine the status of a verifiable credential.

The Working Group is still discussing a unification of design, blending status lists with a single state (such as "revoked" or "suspended") and status lists with multiple states (exposed via a series of status messages). We are seeking implementer feedback on what such a unified design should look like from ease-of-implementation, privacy, and security standpoints.

## Examples

### Example 1: Single State StatusList Credential

A `StatusList` credential contains a list with a singular purpose: "revocation". The list is a bitstring, where each bit represents the status of a verifiable credential. The list is encoded as a base64url-encoded bitstring. The bitstring is decoded to a byte array, which is then decoded to a list of integers. The list of integers is then converted to a list of booleans. The list of booleans is then used to determine the status of a verifiable credential, as shown.

```JSON
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "StatusList2021Credential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:12345",
  "issued": "2021-04-05T14:27:40Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "https://example.com/status/3#list",
    "type": "StatusList2021",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIC3AYbSVKsAQAAA"
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
```

An issuer can then issue a credential with a `credentialStatus` field that utilizes the issued `statusListCredential`.

```JSON
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/23894672394",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:12345",
  "issued": "2021-04-05T14:27:42Z",
  "credentialStatus": {
    "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3#94567",
    "type": "StatusList2021Entry",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "statusListIndex": "94567",
    "statusListCredential": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3"
  },
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:6789",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
```

### Example 2: Multiple State StatusList Credential

A `StatusList` credential may optionally contain a list of status messages. The following example defines statuses for "`0x0`", "`0x1`", and "`0x2`":

```JSON
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "StatusList2021Credential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:12345",
  "issued": "2021-04-05T14:27:40Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "https://example.com/status/3#list",
    "type": "StatusList2021",
    "ttl": 500,
    "statusPurpose": "status",
    "reference": "https://example.org/status-dictionary/",
    "size": 2,
    "statusMessages": [ 
        {"status":"0x0", "value":"valid"},
        {"status":"0x1", "value":"invalid"},
        {"status":"0x2", "value":"pending_review"},
        ...
    ],
    "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3BMQEAAADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIC3AYbSVKsAQAAA"
  }
}
```

An example credential issued to use a multiple state `statusList` looks identical to one issued for a single use.

## Detailed design discussion

There are a variety of privacy and performance considerations that are made when designing, publishing, and processing status lists. The following are some of the considerations that are being discussed by the Working Group.

### Privacy Considerations

#### Correlation between holder, time, and verifier

A privacy concern arises when there is a one-to-one mapping between a verifiable credential and a URL where its status is published. This type of mapping enables the website that publishes the URL to correlate the holder, time, and verifier, whenever the status is checked. This could enable the issuer to discover the type of interaction the holder is having with the verifier, such as providing an age verification credential when entering a bar. Being tracked by the issuer of a driver's license when entering an establishment violates a privacy expectation that many people have today.

#### Malicious Issuers and Verifiers

The herd privacy protections offered by this specification can generally be circumvented by malicious issuers and verifiers. Its privacy benefits can only be realized when issuers and verifiers intend to avoid tracking or sharing the presentation of particular credentials.

A malicious issuer might intentionally attack herd privacy by creating a unique status list per credential issued in order to establish a 1-1 mapping to track when a verifier processes a specific credential. Similarly, they could establish another a 1-1 mapping by using a different cryptographic key for every credential issued that is tracked in a status list.

A malicious verifier might intentionally attack herd privacy by sharing information from presented credentials with a malicious issuer.

### Performance Considerations

There are various performance considerations that are explored when designing status lists. One such consideration is the bandwidth and processing burden a published list places both on the server and on the client fetching the information. Bundling the statuses of large sets of credentials into a single list can help with herd privacy. However, doing so can place an impossible burden on both server and client if the size of the status information is as much as a few hundred bytes per credential across a population of hundreds of millions of holders.

### Addressing Privacy and Performance

The specification proposes a highly compressible, bitstring-based status list mechanism with strong privacy-preserving characteristics, that is compatible with the architecture of the Web, is highly space-efficient, and lends itself well to content distribution networks. For example, using this specification to achieve a number of beneficial privacy and performance goals, it is possible to construct a status list to handle 100,000 verifiable credentials at a maximum size of roughly 12,500 bytes. When only a few hundred of these credentials have been revoked, the size of the list is less than a few hundred bytes while providing privacy for a herd of 100,000 individuals.

* It is possible for verifiers to increase the privacy of holders whose verifiable credentials are being checked by caching status lists that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from verifier-based access patterns on the status list.
* The use of content distribution networks (CDNs) by issuers can increase the privacy of holders by reducing or eliminating requests for the status lists directly from the issuer. Often, a request for a revocation list can be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load on the server, as well as cloaking verifiers and holders from issuers.
